# Spam-Detection-TFIDF

In this Spam Detection - We will detect Spam from Email as well as SMS                                                        

Using TF-IDF                                                                     

We have not preprocessed the data like it does in every tutorial -----We have used the raw data as it is available in real world                          
(1)Main target was to understand the TF-IDF model                                    
(2)Create Tokenizer,tf-idf matrix and use this to train a simple Deep learning model
(2)Creat a base model in keras                                                                                              
(3)Froze the model graph to use the same model in ANDROID Phones                                                               


(2)Spam+Detector using NLTK                                              '
Using Python's inbuilt NLTK library for spam detection
